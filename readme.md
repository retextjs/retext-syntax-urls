## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([retext][]) plugin to classify URL-like values
(such as `example.com`, `index.html`, or `www.alpha.bravo`) as
[`SourceNode`][nlcst-source] instead of natural language.
That node represent ‚Äúexternal (ungrammatical) values‚Äù instead of natural
language, which hides URLs and paths from [`retext-spell`][retext-spell],
[`retext-readability`][retext-readability],
[`retext-equality`][retext-equality], and other things that check words.

## When should I use this?

You can use this plugin any time there are URLs and paths in prose, that are
(incorrectly) warned about by linting plugins.

> üëâ **Note**: this is not a markdown parser.
> Use `unified` with [`remark-parse`][remark-parse] and
> [`remark-retext`][remark-retext] to ‚Äúhide‚Äù other syntax.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install retext-syntax-urls
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import retextSyntaxUrls from 'https://esm.sh/retext-syntax-urls@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import retextSyntaxUrls from 'https://esm.sh/retext-syntax-urls@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Without `retext-syntax-urls`:

```js
import dictionaryEn from 'dictionary-en'
import retextEnglish from 'retext-english'
import retextSpell from 'retext-spell'
import retextStringify from 'retext-stringify'
import retextSyntaxUrls from 'retext-syntax-urls'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'

const file = await unified()
  .use(retextEnglish)
  .use(retextSpell, dictionaryEn)
  .use(retextStringify)
  .process('Have you read readme.md? Check it out: www.example.com/readme.md')

console.log(reporter(file))
```

Yields:

```txt
1:15-1:24 warning `readme.md` is misspelt                 readme-md       retext-spell
1:40-1:55 warning `www.example.com` is misspelt           www-example.com retext-spell
1:56-1:65 warning `readme.md` is misspelt; did you mean ? readme-md       retext-spell

‚ö† 3 warnings
```

With `retext-syntax-urls`:

```diff
   .use(retextEnglish)
+  .use(retextSyntaxUrls)
   .use(retextSpell, dictionaryEn)
```

Yields:

```txt
no issues found
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is [`retextSyntaxUrls`][api-retext-syntax-urls].

### `unified().use(retextSyntaxUrls)`

Classify url-like values (`example.com`, `index.html`, `www.alpha.bravo`) as
syntax instead of natural language.

###### Parameters

There are no parameters.

###### Returns

Nothing (`undefined`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `retext-syntax-urls@^4`,
compatible with Node.js 16.
